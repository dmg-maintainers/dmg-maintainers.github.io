This week a delegation of six staff members, two PhD students and six undergraduate students from the DMG attended the [AustMS meeting](https://www.austms2025.org.au) at Latrobe University. We gave the following talks:

* [Lashi Bandara](../../author/lashi-bandara) -- *The space of rough Riemannian metrics*; *Harmonic analysis and boundary trace for first-order elliptic operators over vector bundles* and *Cutting and gluing via matching boundary conditions*.
* [Reinier Díaz Millán](../../author/reinier-diaz-millan) -- *Frank-Wolfe algorithm for star-convex functions*.
* [Brianna Laird](../../author/brianna-laird) -- *A Steiner Tree Based Genetic Algorithm for Multi-layered Location-Allocation-Routing Problems*.

* [Guillermo Pineda Villavicencio](../../author/guillermo-pineda-villavicencio) - *Colouring of graphs of polytopes*.
* [Iman Shekarriz](../../author/iman-shekarriz) - *Metaheuristic methods for Soft Happy Colouring*.
* [Julien Ugon](../../author/julien-ugon) -- *Proximal-point-like algorithms for abstract convex minimisation problems*.

The ever ubiquitous [Lashi](../../author/lashi-bandara) also participate in the debate ``AI will destroy mathematics'', which was both entertaining and illuminating, and [Lashi](../../author/lashi-bandara) and [Trill White](../../author/trill-white) each presented art work at the mathematical art exhibition.
