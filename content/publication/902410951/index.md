abstract: 'Summary: We consider first-order elliptic differential operators acting
  on vector bundles over smooth manifolds with smooth boundary, which is permitted
  to be noncompact. Under very mild assumptions, we obtain a regularity theory for
  sections in the maximal domain. Under additional geometric assumptions, and assumptions
  on an adapted boundary operator, we obtain a trace theorem on the maximal domain.
  This allows us to systematically study both local and nonlocal boundary conditions.
  In particular, the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary condition occurs as a special case.
  Furthermore, we study contexts which induce semi-Fredholm and Fredholm extensions.'
