abstract: 'Summary: We establish a lower bound theorem for the number of $k$-faces
  ($1\le k\le d-2$) in a $d$-dimensional polytope $P$ (abbreviated as a $d$-polytope)
  with $2d+2$ vertices, extending the previously known case for $k=1$. We identify
  all minimisers for $d\le 5$. Two distinct lower bounds emerge, depending on the
  number of facets of $P$. When $P$ has precisely $d+2$ facets, the lower bound is
  tight when $d$ is odd. If $P$ has at least $d+3$ facets, the lower bound is always
  tight, and equality holds for some $1\le k\le d-2$ only when $P$ has precisely $d+3$
  facets. Moreover, for $1\le k\le \ceil{d/3}-2$, the minimisers among $d$-polytopes
  with $2d+2$ vertices have precisely $d+3$ facets, while for $\floor{0.4d}\le k\le
  d-1$, the lower bound arises from $d$-polytopes with $d+2$ facets.'
