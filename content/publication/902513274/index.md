abstract: 'Summary: We consider smooth vector bundles over smooth manifolds equipped
  with non-smooth geometric data. For nilpotent differential operators acting on these
  bundles, we show that the kernels of induced Hodge-Dirac-type operators remain isomorphic
  under uniform perturbations of the geometric data. We consider applications of this
  to the Hodge-Dirac operator on differential forms induced by so-called rough Riemannian
  metrics, which can be of only measurable coefficient in regularity, on both compact
  and non-compact settings. As a consequence, we show that the kernel of the associated
  non-smooth Hodge-Dirac operator with respect to a rough Riemannian metric remains
  isomorphic to smooth and singular cohomology when the underlying manifold is compact.'
