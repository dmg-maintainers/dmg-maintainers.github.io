abstract: 'Summary: On a smooth connected manifold, we consider all possible locally
  elliptic and locally bounded measurable coefficient Riemannian metrics called rough
  Riemannian metrics. We equip this set with an extended metric which is connected
  if and only if the manifold is compact. We prove that this is a complete length
  extended metric space and the components on which the distance is finite are path-connected.
  Moreover, we identify the closure of smooth metrics in this space to be continuous
  metrics.'
