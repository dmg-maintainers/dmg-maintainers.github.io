abstract: 'Summary: In this paper we introduce two conceptual algorithms for minimising
  abstract convex functions. Both algorithms rely on solving a proximal-type subproblem
  with an abstract Bregman distance based proximal term. We prove their convergence
  when the set of abstract linear functions forms a linear space. This latter assumption
  can be relaxed to only require the set of abstract linear functions to be closed
  under the sum, which is a classical assumption in abstract convexity. We provide
  numerical examples on the minimisation of nonconvex functions with the presented
  algorithms.'
