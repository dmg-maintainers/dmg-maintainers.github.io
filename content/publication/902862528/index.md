abstract: "Summary: To empower the mathematical hitchhiker wishing to use operator
  methods in geometry and topology, we present this user's guide to first-order elliptic
  boundary value problems. Existence, regularity, and Fredholmness are discussed for
  general first-order elliptic operators on manifolds with compact boundary. The focus
  is on a very general class of elliptic boundary conditions, which contain those
  that are pseudo-local as a special case, yielding the relative index theorem. A
  new characterisation of a subclass of elliptic boundary conditions is also given."
