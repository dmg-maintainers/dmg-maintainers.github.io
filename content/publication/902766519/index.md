abstract: 'Summary: In this paper, we obtain necessary optimality conditions for neural
  network approximation. We consider neural networks in Manhattan ($l_1$ norm) and
  Chebyshev ($\max$ norm). The optimality conditions are based on neural networks
  with at most one hidden layer. We reformulate nonsmooth unconstrained optimisation
  problems as larger dimension constrained problems with smooth objective functions
  and constraints. Then we use KKT conditions to develop the necessary conditions
  and present the optimality conditions in terms of convex analysis and convex sets.'
