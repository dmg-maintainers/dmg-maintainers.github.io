abstract: 'Summary: We study the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for minimizing a differentiable
  function with Lipschitz continuous gradient over a compact convex set. To extend
  classical complexity bounds to certain non-convex functions, we focus on the class
  of \emph{star-convex functions}, which retain essential geometric properties despite
  the lack of convexity. We establish iteration-complexity bounds of $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$
  for both the objective values and the duality gap under star-convexity, using diminishing,
  Armijo-type, and Lipschitz-based stepsize rules. Notably, the diminishing and Armijo
  strategies do not require prior knowledge of Lipschitz or curvature constants. These
  results demonstrate that the Frank-Wolfe method preserves optimal complexity guarantees
  beyond the convex setting.'
