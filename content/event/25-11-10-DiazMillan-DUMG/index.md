abstract: 'Hidden within the fabric of mathematics lies a result so universal that it appears across cultures, sciences, and even art. Its countless proofs span from ancient scrolls to presidential sketches, yet its essence remains as captivating as ever. This talk will not only revisit the mystery  behind it but also reveal why, after thousands of years, it continues to challenge, inspire, and surprise.'

Join the Deakin Undergraduate Maths Group for their third session !  

Dr Reinier did his PhD in Optimisation from the Federal University of Goiás, Brazil and his talk is on "The World’s Most Famous Theorem”:
Hidden within the fabric of mathematics lies a result so universal that it appears across cultures, sciences, and even art. Its countless proofs span from ancient scrolls to presidential sketches, yet its essence remains as captivating as ever. This talk will not only revisit the mystery 
behind it but also reveal why, after thousands of years, it continues to challenge, inspire, and surprise.
